The worker process of the algorithm:

1. read the input arguments:
	if the input didn't satisfy the requirement, return;
2. Initialize the shared memory and the semaphores:
	totally three different shared memory: The first one is used to store the number which is under the calculation; the second one is used to record the result of the f[] function; The thrid one is used to record the result of the prime number between the up and the low limit.
3. based on the input number of processes, do the fork operation to generate the exact number of process
4. In each process, we would calculate how many prime factor between[2,1000], this number has. And store result into the shared 	memory1.
5. If the number is between the low and up limit, we would judge if the number is prime number or not. If so, store it into 		shared memory2.
6. Finally, after all the children processes are done. We would output the result in shared memory2 and shared memory3.
